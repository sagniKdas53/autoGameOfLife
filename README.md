## TODO:
* [x] Make the formatting pettier.
* [ ] If a pattern is repeating then refresh it
* [x] Add text boxes to output the grid as a 2D array
* [ ] If possible add a way to upload images, resize it to the canvas size, do edge detection and make the edges as 1 and the rest as 0. Then start the simulation.
* [x] Check if changes to viewport cause any problems.
* [x] move the canvas to 0,0 on the page and all the buttons and other stuff can flex around it.
* [x] find a better color theme, read and white is not good enough.
